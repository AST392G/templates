% This simple template will produce text files which conform with the
% McDonald Observatory format requirements.  
%
% This template can be used for a single section by just uncommenting
% the header for that section or for all needed sections in one 
% document by uncommenting all the headers and the newpage commands.
% The text is then entered in that section.
%
% The science justification is limited to 1 page of text plus 1 page
% of figures and/or references (the user must control this limit).
% The results from previous observing time is also limited to 1 page.
% The other sections are not limited in length but should not
% be used to add science justification.
